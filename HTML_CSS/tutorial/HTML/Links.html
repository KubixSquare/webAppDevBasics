<!-- To create a link you need <a> tags-->
<!-- All the content you add inside the <a> tags will become a reference to another resource-->
<p>
This is a <a>link</a> without an href
</p>

<!--HTML: Attributes-->
<!-- Allow you to add additional features or information to a tag->

<!-- href attribute->
<!-- Sets which resource should be retrieved when the link is reached-->
<p>
<!-- The value of attributes should always be in quotes-->
This is a <a href="Links.html">link</a> with an href
</p>

<!-- target attribute->
<!-- Sets where the page you set in the href attribute should open-->
<p>
    <!-- _blank attribute will open the resource in a new tab/window -->
    This is a <a href="Links.html" target="_blank" >link</a> with an href and a target of _blank
</p>
<p>
    <!-- _self attribute will open the resource in the same window(this is the default behaviour) -->
    This is a <a href="Links.html" target="_self" >link</a> with an href and a target of _self
</p>

<!--Absolute paths-->
<!-- Absolute paths retrieve a specific file from a specific server -->
<p>
    <!-- The absolute paths always include the protocol and the server -->
    This is a <a href="http://localhost:63342/HTMLandCSS/HTML/Links.html">link</a> with an absolute path
</p>

<!--Relative  paths-->
<!-- Relative paths retrieve a file without specifying a server -->
<p>
    <!-- The browser assumes that you refer to  the same server that your page is on -->
    This is a <a href="Links.html">link</a> with an relative path
</p>

<!-- Relative links should be used when linking to pages that are located on the same site -->
<!-- Absolute links should be used when linking to pages that are located on another site/server-->
